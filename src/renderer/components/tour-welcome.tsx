            Electron Fiddle allows you to build little experiments and mini-apps with
            Electron. Each Fiddle has three files: A main script, a renderer script,
            and an HTML file.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you <code>require()</code> a module, Fiddle will install
            it automatically. It will also automatically provide you with autocomplete
            information for the <code>electron</code> module.

            allowing other users to load it by pasting the URL into the address bar.
            If they don't have Electron Fiddle, they can see and download your code
            directly from GitHub.

            You can also package your Fiddle as a standalone binary or as an installer

          <h4>üìù Main Script</h4>
          <p>
            Every Electron app starts with a main script, very similar to how
            a Node.js application is started. The main script runs in the "main
            process". To display a user interface, the main process creates renderer
            processes ‚Äì¬†usually in the form of windows, which Electron calls
            <code>BrowserWindow</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get started, pretend that the main process is just like a Node.js
            process. All APIs and features found in Electron are accessible through
            the <code>electron</code> module, which can be required like any other
            Node.js module.
          </p>
          <p>
            The default fiddle creates a new <code>BrowserWindow</code> and loads
            an HTML file.
          </p>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      name: 'html-editor',
      selector: 'div.mosaic-window.html',
      content: (
        <div>
          <h4>üìù HTML</h4>
          <p>
            In the default fiddle, this HTML file is loaded in the
            <code>BrowserWindow</code>. Any HTML, CSS, or JavaScript that works
            in a browser will work here, too. In addition, Electron allows you
            to execute Node.js code. Take a close look at the
             <code>&lt;script /&gt;</code> tag and notice how we can call <code>
            require()</code> like we would in Node.js.
          </p>
        </div>
      )
    },
    {
      name: 'renderer-editor',
      selector: 'div.mosaic-window.renderer',
      content: (
        <div>
          <h4>üìù  Renderer Script</h4>
          <p>
            This is the script we just required from the HTML file. In here, you can
            do anything that works in Node.js <i>and</i> anything that works in a browser.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the way: If you want to use an <code>npm</code> module here, just
            <code>require</code> it. Electron Fiddle will automatically detect that you
            requested a module and install it as soon as you run your fiddle.
          </p>
