# Electron Fiddle

> :warning: Still a work in progress, please stay tuned.

Electron Fiddle let's you create and play with small Electron experiments. It
greets you with a quick-start template after opening â€“ change a few things,
choose the version of Electron you want to run it with, and play around. Then,
save your fiddle either as a GitHub Gist or to a local folder. Once pushed to
GitHub, anyone can quickly try your fiddle out by just entering it in the
address bar.
